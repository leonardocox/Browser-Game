# Rock Paper Scissors Browser Game

---

## Inspiration for my game

I chose to do a rock paper scissors game because it seemed easy enough to code, and a pretty common web game that if I needed help I would be able to search up help for specific logic questions I had. (Also refer to things to note please to understand why I picked such a simple game and it seems like I only started a couple days ago)

## Controls for my game

Should be pretty simplistic, there are buttons to choose rock/paper/scissoors and that's it!

## Important bugs / things to note

Would like to start off by saying I know this is all going to be committed
basically in one day. I had started a different web game that was going great, but after lots of help and review on the game I realized it was just too advanced for what the guidlines were asking for. My project was going great, I just didn't want it to seem like I was cheating or just copying someone elses code so I basically started this project on a whim. I just want to promise 1000% I really challeneged myself with this project, and I didn't just start this two days ago and that's all I did for the project.

One bug I found is in my deployment my images will not load and I am not sure why, still looking into it,

Just fixed the code for the problem above, I had the assets linked absolutely instead of the correct way!
